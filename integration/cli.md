# The Bunch CLI

The latest version is {% cli bunch version ttscoff/bunchcli %}.

> If using Bunch Beta, use the pre-release version of the CLI: `gem install bunchcli --pre`.
{:.tip.important}

Install the Bunch CLI using `gem install bunchcli`.

Installing the gem provides the executable `bunch`, which should now be in your path.

Run `bunch -h` for usage instructions.

{% cli bunch help %}

Example:

    # Open or Toggle Coding.bunch
    bunch Coding

    # Force open Coding.bunch
    bunch -o Coding


The command line tool can also be used to generate Bunch URLs for use in other applications. To output any command as a URL instead of executing it, add `-u`:

    bunch -o Coding -u

To generate a URL interactively, run:

    bunch -i
