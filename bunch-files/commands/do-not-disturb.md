# Do Not Disturb Commands

Toggle notifications. The commands can be abbreviated as `(dnd on)` and `(dnd off)`. Actually, `(dnd on)` can just be `(dnd)`, too. I like to make things intuitive by over complicating them sometimes.

If you want to control Focus Modes, you'll need to do a [little extra setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/integration/focus-modes/).

## Examples

```bunch
(dnd on) // or just (dnd)
(dnd off)
```
