# Awake Commands

`(awake)` will keep your Screensaver from activating and your display from sleeping. If you specify an interval in the format `XhXmXs` (e.g. `2h` or `1h30m`) then Bunch will stop keeping your machine awake after that period of time. Any running `awake` command will be terminated when the Bunch is closed or the application is quit.

If the application should happen to terminate unexpectedly, the `awake` command may continue running in the background. In this case, just launch Bunch again and {% kbd cmd-opt-click %} the Bunch containing the `awake` command to force close.
