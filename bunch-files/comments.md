# Commenting a Bunch

Comments can be included in your Bunch files. They can be used to remind yourself what a long [key combo]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/bunch-files/keystrokes/) string or a why apps are in a specific sequence, or they can be used to explain things when sharing Bunches with others. (Admittedly, they're mostly so I can clearly explain things in example Bunches.)

## Line comments

Line comments are preceded by `#` or `//`. They can be at the beginning of a line, or included with a regular line at the end. Comment indicators must be followed by one or more spaces, and inline comments (comments at the end of a line) must also be preceded by one or more spaces, e.g. `AppName // Inline comment`.

> Inline comments can not be used on the same line as fragment headers, variable assignment lines, or script lines.
{:.warning}

```bunch
// This is a line comment
# This is also a line comment

%MailMate // this is an inline comment
@Xcode # This is also an inline comment

# Not to be confused with snippet fragment identifiers,
# which don't have a space before or after
<Useful.snippets#Fragment ID

# Though you can use comments *after* a fragment ID...
<Useful.snippets#Fragment ID # as long as it's surrounded by spaces

// Also not to be confused with fragment identifiers in snippets,
// which function as comments but also require square brackets
###[My Fragment]###

// But they won't work on a fragment divider line
###[My Fragment]### # This fragment won't be found.

// Inline comments also won't work on script lines
$ echo # This comment is part of the command, even though the shell will ignore it
// Or on variable assignments
my_var = Value # This comment is read as part of the value
```

## Block Comments

Block comments can also be used. These are delineated with `/*` at the beginning, and `*/` at the end. These markers can be on the same line or on their own line.

```bunch
/* This is a block comment
   It has a couple of lines */

/******************************
/* This is also a block comment
/* with some decoration.
/*
/* It will keep going until the
/* end marker.
/******************************/

/*
Or keep it simple
*/
```
